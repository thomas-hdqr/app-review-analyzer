Even on your worst day, just by naming 3 good things can help improve your mood. The 3 good things could be simple, like the weather felt nice outside today. I got to sleep in a little later today. Or I was able to afford McDonalds breakfast this morning instead of cooking or worse, not being able to eat at all. Appreciate the little positive things about life. I love how the app lets you add pictures and a little short entry, but also an emoji you can choose to represent your day. Once your entered enough, it creates these cute slideshow videos. Also, you can join pods and can choose which entries you would like to share or not. You can also create your own pod. For example, I made one called ‚ÄúHappy Girls are the Prettiest,‚Äù which I made for a group of girls like me. Maybe a mom. Maybe someone struggling with depression or low self esteem. It‚Äôs my motivational entries I share in this pod to remind myself & others than inner beauty is worth so much more than outer beauty. \nBut anyways, YES YES YES, I Would definitely recommend to all!",

That‚Äôs very disappointing to me that I can‚Äôt easily access and see my full month in a view. I have to pay for premium to see photos, memories and moments.

The app can have its downs, but I still rate it a five. When I am sad or just wanna type something, or share something I did that day I go to this app. I live letting people see what I did in the day to have fun, tester I posted and was NOT having fun but that doesn‚Äôt matter!

The free version is complete meaning you don't have to pay for basic use. The upgrade/paid version allows you to do more like export but isn't required for longterm daily use. I am very happy with it and will probably upgrade soon to be able to export but also because I just want to support this awesome app! Definitely recommend!\nPro tip: I read a review once that mentioned a mom who used specific emojis for each kiddo so occasionally she could sit with that kid and search for the positive posts and moments about that specific person! I LOVE that idea and it could definitely be applied to other categories or groups! Enjoy! üíö",

Even on your worst day, just by naming 3 good things can help improve your mood. The 3 good things could be simple, like the weather felt nice outside today. I got to sleep in a little later today. Or I was able to afford McDonalds breakfast this morning instead of cooking or worse, not being able to eat at all. Appreciate the little positive things about life. I love how the app lets you add pictures and a little short entry, but also an emoji you can choose to represent your day. Once your entered enough, it creates these cute slideshow videos. Also, you can join pods and can choose which entries you would like to share or not. You can also create your own pod. For example, I made one called ‚ÄúHappy Girls are the Prettiest,‚Äù which I made for a group of girls like me. Maybe a mom. Maybe someone struggling with depression or low self esteem. It‚Äôs my motivational entries I share in this pod to remind myself & others than inner beauty is worth so much more than outer beauty. \nBut anyways, YES YES YES, I Would definitely recommend to all!",

I‚Äôm not always great at doing it every day but really try to make sure I have something for each day.

That‚Äôs very disappointing to me that I can‚Äôt easily access and see my full month in a view. I have to pay for premium to see photos, memories and moments.

Each entry max‚Äôs out at 560 with 4 photos or one video but you can do up to 10 entries per day. The calendar view is cool to look at as you fill a whole month. If you forget to write. It doesn‚Äôt matter how long you go without writing. If you go on a week vacation and don‚Äôt have time. You get to keep your streak as long as you enter the days in the chronological order. Never skip a day. There‚Äôs also a map view that shows where the geological data of the photo was taken. Cool to see all the places i‚Äôve been. it doesn‚Äôt track you just logs the data in the photo if it even has my favorite feature is the face ID lock. let‚Äôs me feel more comfortable writing more personal stuff in my personal daily journal. Amazing app. I recommend to all my friends",

Through using this app for about 9 months now I have been able to see the benefit of having the memories of both good and bad days. I appreciates it user-friendliness and how the streak screen continues to encourage you. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to be more consistent with journaling and just needs a place to start. An added bonus is the community aspect and been able to enjoy life and moments with people even when they are far away.",

    "text": "Like other reviews, I love this app and feel it has changed my life. I have been in therapy for a long time. I have my ups and downs, but this app has made the quickest improvement in my mood. I love the photo feature! It makes looking at my happiness feed more satisfying, it forces my camera roll to be more joyful, and by the act of taking a photo and looking at them, i get exponentially more joy out of the app/happiness reason. It makes the happiness feel more concrete, tangible, like, look at this real actual moment in time that caused you joy, it is less fleeting than a positive thought, it allows you hold onto the joy more. Because of the app I go through my day really seeking out a positive, which really makes me spend more of my headspace on something good, which has a truly positive effect on my mood. I have only been using it for about a month or two and I started to notice a change a few weeks in. I love the reminders of what made me happy a month ago, I hope over time it will give me notification for 6 months ago, a year ago, 3 months, etc. Normally a month the item is so recent I haven‚Äôt had the chance to forget it. which i guess is good but it would like to get a random reminder of what made you happy six months or a year ago. I paid for the full version and it is entirely worth it. I‚Äôve had days that i didn‚Äôt think were that great but then when I realized I counted up the maximum, ten good things that day, it changed my perspective on how the day went.",
