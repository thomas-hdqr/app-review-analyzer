I went to the FAQ and it said I needed to go to the Habit Manager, but that was for removing the habit completely. I finally got it to take me to the page showing my weekly goal, which was showing as complete even though it wasn’t. I had to manually visit each day and use the reset option. \n\nAfter all of that, I ended up creating the habit from scratch to make sure I got the settings right, and the same thing happened again. I went ahead and uninstalled it after that. \n\nI’m fairly tech savvy and can usually work out new apps and interfaces without too much trouble. So, chalk it up to human error, but I don’t think it should be so confusing for an average person like me to check a box on a calendar.",

    "text": "Response to developer: I submitted a refund request twice and chatted with two Apple reps. They told me the thing I paid $6.99 for wasn’t a lifetime subscription and that by paying $8.99 I was upgrading. That’s not true as you know. Apple told me to contact you, the developer. I’ve never had a more frustrating experience in the App Store. I can’t believe it.\n\nI purchased a lifetime membership for the discounted offer of $6.99, then the app charged me for the same membership at the full price of $8.99. I requested a refund from Apple for the duplicate full membership charge and was told that it was “Not eligible for refund”??? This is a scam that Apple is allowing.",

This little app packs a punch with all the touches, habit hiding feature, multiple ways to do something so you’ll find your favorite way of organizing your habit. This app is going to rocket to the top. I also appreciate the reasonable “Buy for Life” without the subscription. Job well done!

If you use GiHub, you know how motivating it is to see this scope of time. Tracking your habits over the course of a year is the appropriate scope because habits often don’t “kick-in” or matter for almost close to a year. Having a year-long target means you’re getting a realistic understanding of the effect of a habit and not just a short snapshot, which doesn’t inform you much about the story of long-term positive change. Habits are fully customizable with frequency, weekly targets, color, name, icon, reminders, duration, units to measure (minutes, hours, miles, kilometers). You can even create your own units! Want to do 100 backflips per day , three days per weeks between Monday - Friday at 11:30AM!? You can do that with this app! This app has, is, and will continue to change my life. Download it now!",

You can edit pretty much everything to your liking, and when I downloaded it I had a deal to spend a couple dollars to get a chart that made it easier for me to track, the daily things get darker in color depending how many you completed (ex. I made my “drink 10 bottles of water/day” section blue, if I drink all 10 the little square will fill in the blue. If you drink none it stays white, drink some it’s a light blue) and the things you want to quit stay the color you chose if you had none of whatever it is and get darker in color the more you have. like I’m trying to quit drinking, if you exceed the limit that you set then it turns black.
