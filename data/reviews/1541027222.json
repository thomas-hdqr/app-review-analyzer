It's actually useful to stop me from spending forever to procrastinate something I need to do, it intervenes and I can actually consciously decide to get work done.\n\nOne bug though: When on Mac, there's a particular app (osu!) that doesn't immediately close, and when I quit the app it leaves behind an annoying block screen which SHOULD disappear, but when I click \"Close\" it doesn't go away. I have to use an extra open to get it to go away.\n\nBut other than that, this is a great app more people should use.",

It also will not show me notifications anymore for limited apps, such as Instagram messages. I had to re-enable Amazon shopping because whenever I disabled it, it also disabled my Alexa app which I need to use on a regular basis.

I’m not really motivated externally, I’m very internally motivated, so this was honestly the best and most helpful feature!\n\nThe locked screen also has the number of times I’ve opened the app, so I can keep track of my screentime in a much more active way, rather than the more reactive “check screentime in settings and be annoyed about it”.\n\nI can honestly say I’ve forgotten to check Instagram reels now. It took months but I went from 1 hour per day to like, nothing. Although to be fair, that might just be because I’m way busier now, and reels is getting worse (somehow).\n\nThanks for creating such an incredible app!",

The app further includes a count of the number of days users achieve our goal of limiting screen time, but this streak can be gone due to accidentally clicking on the unlock option of an app, even when it was cancelled immediately, and the screen time usage never exceeded the target. This could create a lot of frustration for users. Changing the way the app determines our streak could help improve user experience.",

    "text": "I have found ScreenZen super helpful in cutting down my time spend scrolling on social media. I was just remarking to my husband how I used to spend hours a day scrolling on TikTok and today I only logged 10mins. I am also doing my own form of habit tracking for other habits, but this app has been so helpful in keeping down my scrolling time. I thought I needed a dumb phone to get my scrolling under control, but ScreenZen is doing the trick. Thank you!",
