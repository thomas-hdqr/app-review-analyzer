    "text": "Crazy how these large corporations made social media apps so powerful that I'll subconsciously go on Instagram and snapchat without even thinking about it. I'm not a scroller and wouldn't endlessly scroll on social media but I would go on them to check notifications. Whenever there was pause in a video game, nothing going on in the moment in life, or I'm bored, I'd naturally pick up my phone and by default go to Instagram with 0 purpose. After I downloaded one sec and bought premium it made my unconscious habit conscious. It makes me ask myself in my head, \"is there anything I absolutely need to do on this app?\" If the answer is no, I get off. The habit has subsided too because my mind associates checking social media as one sec popping up. So grateful I got this because I'm a lot more mindful and in the moment than I was before and I'm a lot happier and less irritable. I highly recommend you get this app because if your someone like me who doesn't wanna delete their socials, this makes you in control of your decision to go on these high dopamine apps rather than the corporation being in control of you.",

    "text": "This is a very clever application that does precisely what it’s advertised to. It requires a form of intervention before opening an app of your choice, and this is highly customizable. There are lots of interventions to choose from, and how long you want them to be. You can also have it choose a random exercise for you, and it supports website blocking as well, which is nice. You can also set up a bedtime schedule where it blocks all apps and websites. It provides an informative dashboard detailing approximately how much time you saved. However, I really can’t get behind the modern era of subscription based apps. Especially for the lifetime license costing a whopping FIFTY dollars, and SEVENTY for a “family plan”. I don’t have any problem supporting independent developers and paying for software, but I personally feel like this is overpriced for what it does. Most of it is just relying on the iOS shortcuts functionality anyway, and all the app is doing is showing a pretty GUI and recording the time. You could replicate something similar in shortcuts (although not entirely, like website blocking for instance.) If you don’t mind the cost, go for it, but I would probably pay $15 maximum for a lifetime license, not $50. Especially considering many people using this are likely college students.",

I'm not a scroller and wouldn't endlessly scroll on social media but I would go on them to check notifications. Whenever there was pause in a video game, nothing going on in the moment in life, or I'm bored, I'd naturally pick up my phone and by default go to Instagram with 0 purpose. After I downloaded one sec and bought premium it made my unconscious habit conscious. It makes me ask myself in my head, \"is there anything I absolutely need to do on this app?\" If the answer is no, I get off. The habit has subsided too because my mind associates checking social media as one sec popping up. So grateful I got this because I'm a lot more mindful and in the moment than I was before and I'm a lot happier and less irritable. I highly recommend you get this app because if your someone like me who doesn't wanna delete their socials, this makes you in control of your decision to go on these high dopamine apps rather than the corporation being in control of you.",

There are lots of interventions to choose from, and how long you want them to be. You can also have it choose a random exercise for you, and it supports website blocking as well, which is nice. You can also set up a bedtime schedule where it blocks all apps and websites. It provides an informative dashboard detailing approximately how much time you saved. However, I really can’t get behind the modern era of subscription based apps. Especially for the lifetime license costing a whopping FIFTY dollars, and SEVENTY for a “family plan”. I don’t have any problem supporting independent developers and paying for software, but I personally feel like this is overpriced for what it does. Most of it is just relying on the iOS shortcuts functionality anyway, and all the app is doing is showing a pretty GUI and recording the time. You could replicate something similar in shortcuts (although not entirely, like website blocking for instance.) If you don’t mind the cost, go for it, but I would probably pay $15 maximum for a lifetime license, not $50. Especially considering many people using this are likely college students.",

When I try to pause the block, it says I don’t have any apps selected so it won’t affect my phone use. I was hoping to get back to the app, but it’s impossible until the timer is up. I hope that this will be a simple fix; if there are no apps being blocked, the user should be able to pause the block to return to the app.",

    "text": "I’m a student who has been struggling with procrastination for as long as I can remember. My phone, through social media and video games, has often been my source of that. I’ve tried other screen time apps in a desperate attempt to fix my problem, but all of them are easy to bypass and default back to wasting time. I was afraid that I would never be able to break the cycle. \n\nOne Sec is the only program that forces you to reflect. And I mean, really, it forces you to reflect on yourself before you open the app that you designed. There’s nothing fancy about it - no bells and whistles like the other apps. That’s because change doesn’t come with bells and whistles, it comes from within. I’ve been using One Sec for only a day and I’ve managed to drop my average screen time about an hour and a half. It’s incredible, and I’m really giddy about how much I’ve been able to improve myself in only a day.\n\nThat being said, the downside of One Sec is that it doesn’t have any bells and whistles. You have to manually implement the shortcuts for all of the apps you want to block, and that is the meat and potatoes of this app - you don’t get much else that significantly helps you stop overusing apps. On top of that, the dashboard (overview) page of the app has very little content besides the list of apps that you blocked by hand and how much time you’ve saved through using One Sec (which seems inaccurate as I tend to spend a lot more time than three minutes every time I clicked on an app). \n\nBut overall, this app is a great program that can help you beat overuse. More content and programs are sure to come as this app is just beginning, and I really look forward to it. I think that there are a lot of great things that can happen with this app, such as more content being added to the overview page (overall screen time, usage trend graphs, times you’ve continued to use the app despite the One Sec timer, etc) and making it easier to block apps. I’m very happy with One Sec and would recommend it to anyone looking to make a change for the better.",
