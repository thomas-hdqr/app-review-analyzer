It is sorted alphabetically now which is a plus but between the keyboard showing up by default and the new navigation in general it is not very user friendly. It is also laggy and inconvenient.\n\nAlso huge L on the daily streak system. It is not a huge deal but I am salty that I lost my 130 day streak due to a bug?

This app has great features, isn‚Äôt bloated with nonsense, is simple to use, and affordable. I hope the developers continue to improve it though as it‚Äôs not without its flaws and does leave some to be desired.\n\nAreas where there are some room for improvement:\n\nAccuracy - there are times when I‚Äôm logging a food manually and switch from ounces to grams when I noticed the outcomes of the macros are not the same despite them equaling the same weight.\n\nPlanning - I don‚Äôt need anything fancy here, but I would love to be able to click on the next day and plan a some of my meals.\n\nServing sizes - there are times when I use the search feature to find a food only to discover that I‚Äôm not able to use gram, ounces, cups or really any measurements other than the ‚Äústandard‚Äù serving size. However, with these pre-logged food items it‚Äôs not clear how much the serving size is nor is it even listed.\n\nCalories burned - when toggling this feature on it adds to your daily calories based on what you‚Äôve burned that day. However, it‚Äôll tell you that you have more calories that you can eat, but it does not calculate what that should translate to in macros.",

Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt grasp the full ingredients from the pics and that needs improvements. Also as someone who like to have everything in the health app, the integration to the health app would be great and make things a lot more convenient for everyone. Another thing would be the water settings, have like a water feature where you remind the person to drink their desired goal of water to drink everyday. This would remind and motivate those to actually drink water. Also I think they should add a feature where it calculates the works out you do. Currently it takes steps you do, but that‚Äôs just not enough. There‚Äôs so much potential with this app, 3 stars is where I feel like it‚Äôs at for me.",

However, with these pre-logged food items it‚Äôs not clear how much the serving size is nor is it even listed.\n\nCalories burned - when toggling this feature on it adds to your daily calories based on what you‚Äôve burned that day.

Sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt grasp the full ingredients from the pics and that needs improvements. Also as someone who like to have everything in the health app, the integration to the health app would be great and make things a lot more convenient for everyone. Another thing would be the water settings, have like a water feature where you remind the person to drink their desired goal of water to drink everyday. This would remind and motivate those to actually drink water. Also I think they should add a feature where it calculates the works out you do. Currently it takes steps you do, but that‚Äôs just not enough. There‚Äôs so much potential with this app, 3 stars is where I feel like it‚Äôs at for me.",
