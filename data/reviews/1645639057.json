However, I‚Äôve encountered issues with blocking websites. \n\nI use the browser version of social media because the annoying UI deters me from going on them so much. When I saw refocus I was so excited because it would give me another opportunity to hinder my social media habits. However, I was disappointed because the self-set unblocking timer does not remain accurate on websites. I‚Äôve found most times it fails to go off/reboock sites until much much longer than the timers I set (ex. I unblock for 3 minutes and it unblocks for 15-20). In apps, the timed unblocking feature  works excellently, but on websites it has proven extremely unreliable. If this were fixed I would be so grateful.\n\nIf it‚Äôs any use for the bug-fixing I‚Äôve encountered this issue using instagram.com and youtube.com on Google.",

I‚Äôve only used the free version and while the upgraded version seems to offer even better features, I have been able to get everything I need out of the free version with the scheduled blocking and optional timed blocking. It is so much more than and better than the simple time limit offered in my phone settings, which doesn‚Äôt block the time at which I can access apps, only how long I spend on them. Refocus does it all, even the free version. It creates a physical block between me and the apps that sap my time and take me away from important projects when it‚Äôs hard for me to make that decision myself.
