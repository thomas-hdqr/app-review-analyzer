    "text": "This app has genuinely improved my life. \n\nThis team/company clearly values actually helping people. \n\nFirst, the app (on Mac and iOS) works far more consistently than numerous others I've tried. Second, it's obvious this isn't a group of people just further capitalizing on the attention economy under the guise of benevolence. The price structure is much more reasonable (esp. with the lifetime option which I'm switching to soon) than most other apps. And again, it works really seamlessly.\n\nDoes it have some glitches, sure. I blame that more on Apple's enigmatic Screentime system that Jomo has mostly wrangled very well.\n\nThe strict modes and break options literally thread a needle of being really strict but also allowing JUST enough slack in case you really need to check something, or even just reward yourself with a quick doom scroll.\n\nIt's as flexible as you really could need it to be and thus feels like a companion for mindful screentime rather than a judgemental chastity belt for your device and how you use it.\n\nBravo team! You're genuinely making a difference in people's lives.",

Both platform apps are extremely comprehensive and well built, and support almost all browsers INCLUDING FIREFOX\n-Really tough blocking. ‚ÄúOther‚Äù apps are too simple to disable blocks/rules that you set. Jomo has some hardcore features that really make it tough to break through\n-Highly customizable configurations. With a Plus account, you can really customize block times, amounts, unlocks, etc. It‚Äôs very detailed and allows you to set it how you like\n-Super reasonable price! ‚ÄúOther‚Äù apps charged a CRAZY amount; Jomo has super reasonable pricing, especially with the annual subscription, or even the lifetime pass\n-Responsive support! The team was super responsive to some questions I had, and it‚Äôs clear they really care about building and maintaining this app\n\nShout out to Jomo and the team behind it; they really thought of everything.

Both platform apps are extremely comprehensive and well built, and support almost all browsers INCLUDING FIREFOX\n-Really tough blocking. ‚ÄúOther‚Äù apps are too simple to disable blocks/rules that you set. Jomo has some hardcore features that really make it tough to break through\n-Highly customizable configurations. With a Plus account, you can really customize block times, amounts, unlocks, etc. It‚Äôs very detailed and allows you to set it how you like\n-Super reasonable price! ‚ÄúOther‚Äù apps charged a CRAZY amount; Jomo has super reasonable pricing, especially with the annual subscription, or even the lifetime pass\n-Responsive support! The team was super responsive to some questions I had, and it‚Äôs clear they really care about building and maintaining this app\n\nShout out to Jomo and the team behind it; they really thought of everything. I‚Äôm really excited to get it dialed in, and can‚Äôt wait to see what the future of this app brings!",

The UI was clunky and confusing. So even though i had subscribed for a year, i set it to cancel and not renew. I looked for other apps to replace it, and tried mainly the high rated/top downloaded suggestions in the App Store. However those seemed to be worse than Jomo. I was surprised given Jomo is a small team. So anyway I reinstalled this app and just accepted its quirks. Suddenly I saw an update was available! This was the first ever update I had experienced. I actually thought this team had given up on the app and would never update it. So it was a pleasant surprise! Then I saw more and more updates (dare I saw regular updates)? Now I am ready to renew my subscription again! I am in love with the new UI and the fixes to bugs, and improvements based on feedback (I.e lock screens being made simple and dark). I want this app to succeed and get even better!! I am thankful to this app for improving my phone abuse and lowering my screen time. Thank you JOMO TEAM!!!",

I encourage you to try hard rules to see just how much you've come to crave digital distraction. It's humbling, and sobering. It makes you realize how necessary it is to change these patterns and habits to make technology serve us rather than the other way around. \n\nMy phone use got out of control during the pandemic, with screen time regularly above 4 hours a day (some days were 7, 8, 9).\n\nWith Jomo and some other life changes, it's around 35 minutes a day. Which is how it should be. \n\nWe were not meant to doomscroll. We were not meant to check notifications every few minutes.

If I could manually add other screens and say I watched TV for an hour and add that to the total screen time, then it would be more accurate in my opinion. Also, I think the analytics could be better / more intuitive, as in being able to graph over time the pick ups vs screen time vs notifications etc., making a pie chart of your usage over a given period of time, or being able to filter the data to see how much of the last week or month has been taken up by certain categories. It would also be nice to choose the time period you can see rather than just a week or 28 days, and really just making the analytic section more user friendly and robust in general. For some reason it‚Äôs not graphing the data I had previous to getting the app even though it shows up in the daily Home Screen.

Request: add calendar integration so that I can dynamically trigger sessions based on events.\n3. Request: Enable full size on Mac.

Couple things I‚Äôve noted in my use:\n\n‚Ä¢ Not sure if there was a proper walkthrough of each restriction option when I got the free trial, but I found I stuck to ‚ÄúConscious Break‚Äù because that‚Äôs the first one I tried and didn‚Äôt know how the others worked. A pop up walkthrough would definitely encourage me to use more features\n\n‚Ä¢ I wish I could personalize the timer on how long I have to wait to take a conscious break. So, it starts at 5-6 seconds, but I need that to be at least 15 in order for me to give up and go back to my task (for a truly conscious break). Worried it created a bad habit where I just set my phone down and wait for the longer countdowns and take an unconscious break because the 5-6 second unlock time was too easy to get through\n\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm really not sure if there‚Äôs anything you can do about this one üòÜ but when using the intention unlock feature, I‚Äôve just typed a random letter to unlock it. Sometimes I use it properly‚Äîthat helps my ADHD brain stay focused for sure. But I definitely get around it too quickly for it to be a truly conscious break\n\n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôd be great if the notifications of ‚Äútime to get back to focusing‚Äù didn‚Äôt happen 30 seconds before the app closes. I wish it‚Äôd be more like 2 minutes before so I can save a video for later or wind down from my feed. I get frustrated and always fear losing the post when it kicks me out way too quickly.\n\nI only tried the free version of Opal, but that was a little too hard to get into apps, and I think I rebelled a bit by the end and didn‚Äôt want to restrict myself at all. I like the flexibility of Jomo instead.  \n\nOverall, I‚Äôm not sure if I like this app or Opal Better. I think price is much better here. If you guys gamify Jomo the way Opal does (theirs is a bit overkill though) and tighten up some features, you‚Äôd have an incredible product.\n\nAll that being said, it‚Äôs definitely helped me focus.

I started by blocking the two sites I spent the most of my doomscrolling time on, and received very pleasant screens which encouraged me to be more mindful of my use when I did try and log on to them.

I like that it‚Äôs more flexible than apple screen time, but I can also set it up so I can‚Äôt unblock my apps (one of the biggest downsides of apple screen time imo). I also love that it‚Äôs on Mac too so I can control my screen time on my computer.",

If i even try to open another tab, it immediately shields me from searching anything and gives motivational little popups each time which i find really interesting. the features are super helpful since you can make your own sessions and block specific websites or even block every website except the ones you want to work on which i find very efficient. I searched for so many apps to help me focus but this app is the only one that has done that job properly",

    "text": "Look this is a good app but it had a major major flaw. You can simply go into screen time settings and disable Jomo permissions effectively rending it useless. Now they will tell you you can setup a shortcut to try and avoid this and it's possible but fundamentally for something that's asking for this much money it shouldn't have this flaw. The reality is apps like opal and Jomo all they do is plug into the offering screentime settings give you already with some granularity.",

    "text": "I have type one diabetes and all of my medical devices I wear to help keep me living are controlled using apps on my phone. For this reason I must have my phone on me 24/7. When I first started wearing these medical monitors and having to carry my phone everywhere it was so exhausting. I struggled to stay off my phone 24/7 and wished I could just do something without having my phone with me. I am so thankful I found this screen time app. It made all of the difference for my mental health. I went from scrolling 24/7 to having firm boundaries with my phone I could not break. I tried others before Jomo and many of them were not only more expensive but they also had a ton of glitches. After switching to Jomo I will never go back to another. Even family members have commented on the positive differences they have noticed since I started using this app. If you are considering using it I would 100% recommend this app without hesitation.",
