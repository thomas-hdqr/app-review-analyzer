I do not like exercize apps like this one that solely make me hunt for and select my workout pieces and parts to put together to create a .... 30mt workout.  In addition, I cannot change the duration of the rest period.  In my opinion, it is too long.

    "text": "I have no way to message you guys directly but, honestly I have been doing it as a way to not get healthy but to help redirect my anger when I play games. It‚Äôs genuinely helped on a whole other level where I can remember having issues doing one workout then a few weeks later that workout feels easy to do and I end up with a new workout that out does me. I haven‚Äôt noticed any real bodily change besides feeling stronger and healthier. But I‚Äôm only a few months in and only now getting into the serious workouts so I bet I notice a change later down the line. Regardless of your reasons for designing this app, it truly has helped me significantly and I look forward to getting into an even more healthy lifestyle.",

    "text": "Here‚Äôs your text corrected while keeping your original wording:\n\n‚ÄúI used this app before, and by default, you used to have the ability to increase the difficulty to be as hard as possible or as easy as possible, but it had a limit‚Äîunless I‚Äôm tripping, because this is mind-straining and confusing. I press ‚Äòeasy‚Äô and ‚Äòeasy,‚Äô but it still doesn‚Äôt make it easier. Sometimes, the ‚Äòeasy‚Äô doesn‚Äôt make any sense at all; one has 10 exercises, then the next ‚Äòeasy‚Äô has 12 exercises, then 14. What happened to the limits on how easy or hard you can make it? Make it make sense. If you‚Äôre going to have an ‚Äòeasy‚Äô option, make it easy to the point that you can‚Äôt make it any easier. If you‚Äôre going to make it limitless, then make ‚Äòhard‚Äô super intense or ‚Äòeasy‚Äô super simple‚Äîdon‚Äôt mix it up. And when I say make something harder, don‚Äôt make it easier than the previous ‚Äòharder‚Äô five times.‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs your text with corrected grammar, keeping your exact words:\n\n‚ÄúYes, I honestly used ChatGPT to correct my grammar before I send this using the exact words I used, but unless I‚Äôm tripping, maybe there is some way to make limited easy and hard options appear, because that would be cool. I mean, imagine saying, ‚ÄòYes, I worked out and did legs on max difficulty,‚Äô but now you can‚Äôt because you guys removed the limits and failed to make it extraordinarily difficult. How am I supposed to know if it‚Äôs going to be in a range of difficulty limits or not, since it‚Äôs unlimited? So yeah, anyways, I‚Äôm done.‚Äù\n\nYou know what it what it is upsets me but I‚Äôll find someway to use this app so yeah. I probably am an ignorant tard to write this.",
