Wishlist: it seems the iPhone version uses whatever timing the timer was set for last rather than saving the last timings within each tag. Each activity I do I usually want to do for the same amount of time each day, which is different for each tag, so it would be convenient to jump right to it without having to adjust every time when switching between tags. Also, for the Apple Watch version, it seems the data is not saved on the device at all, since I have lost pomos by being in airplane mode. Would love to be able to use without connectivity and be able to have the pomos show up again when online.",

Wishlist: it seems the iPhone version uses whatever timing the timer was set for last rather than saving the last timings within each tag. Each activity I do I usually want to do for the same amount of time each day, which is different for each tag, so it would be convenient to jump right to it without having to adjust every time when switching between tags. Also, for the Apple Watch version, it seems the data is not saved on the device at all, since I have lost pomos by being in airplane mode.

I commonly forget it’s supposed to be a tomato and not an orange because it’s orange. \n\nNow, I do like how it is orange, but I at the very least want the option to make it red (so that they’re actually tomatoes and not oranges). The only reason I rated it 4 stars was so that developers could be more likely to see this than if I rated it 5 stars. If I get a response I’ll change it! 🤠👍",

Or, customize the tomatoes themselves! Completed pomodoros could earn greater rewards, while incomplete ones could yield smaller ones.

As soon as opening it I was hit with like 6 different screens I had to get past only to find that it does not look like it allows you to do pretty much anything on the free version and you will never catch me buying an app blindly without using it. I’m not about to try a seven day free trial and forget about it because I’m using this is for ADHD and staying on task so the likely of me remembering to cancel a free trial are low. Moving on to the next app in the “market” and deleting this one. \n\nIf there is a way to use the free I suggest making this much more user friendly to not have a bunch of screens to click through and then a random list of things that are behind paywalls.
