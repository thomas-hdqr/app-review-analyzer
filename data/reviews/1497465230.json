    "text": "I first used Opal only for the free trial.  The app works great and as intended and helped reduce procrastination during work. However, the app selector continuously crashes, which makes creating screen focus profiles difficult. Additionally, the limited number of apps I can select seems to defeat the purpose.  Why not let the user select as many apps to block as they want?  That being said, I came back to Opal because it was the best app for me. Design is beautiful, just wish there were less glitches in one of the most important parts of the app.",

I can specifically choose the apps that are a problem and leave the apps that I need for work or that don't really I use in a healthy way. That has changed over time because I found some apps are more problematic than I realized and I added them which was pretty easily done.... On the medium setting I kept ending up back on my phone.  I finally bit the bullet and put it on the hard setting at least or in the morning where I  CAN'T OPEN  selected apps. I maybe needed the medium setting  to prove that I don't have control over my phone use without a hard no.  When I admitted I was powerless over my phone and my life had become unmanageable I was ready to use the app shut down opal can provide and I'm very grateful to this company for creating this really flexible app that allows me to use it and not have to buy a flip phone.",
