For example, ClearSpace you pick how long you want to use the app at a time (from 1-10 minutes) right as you open the app. Then, when time runs out, it says, “the time you set aside for this app is over.” Theoretically I could unlock the app again but I never do…because the app is reminding me that I picked that shorter time (I usually pick 5 minutes, never 10), so I feel compelled to stick to it!

There’s no pause to the behavior with the flow. But with ClearSpace it is very methodically designed to procedurally provide a forced slowdown to mindfully choose your next step, and then further establishes a next level time limit even if you choose to use the app in question. I LOVE that if I choose to use one of my locked apps I have pre-determined amounts of use each day and when I use it for the length of time I choose it locks back up again! This feature is gold for accountability and follow-through. After using the free version and now the free trial, I will be going with the subscription.  I feel like I am back in control of my phone usage, keeping all of the utilitarian benefits of my phone without the hazards. I was close to chucking it for a dumb phone, but with ClearSpace, I don’t feel like I have to make such an extreme change. Thank you!",

I often only get it to count 60-70% of the pushups I do, and get tired have to stop. Having done 25-40 pushups but only getting credit for 15-25. That needs to be fixed. Also needs more exercises or tasks for min. And don’t make them just 7day challenges, make it so I can select always have to earn min. Or I can pick ships or squats. And who gives an f about inviting friends to my challenges. Just let me choose any activity for min, depending on what I want to do.",

I use it now three times a day for under 5 minutes each. I don’t miss it. The most powerful part of the app is that it has you complete a few steps before opening Instagram (or whatever app you are trying to manage). This causes you to consider whether you really need to be doing this with your time. It does not make you feel guilty. You must first open the notification you receive which requires you to take one deep breath. Then gives you a powerful quote to read and after you select whether or not you still want to visit the app. This step alone has made me rethink my choices. Finally you select how long you want to spend on the app. It’s a great product. Definitely recommend!",
